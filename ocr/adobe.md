#### Q1. What is the purpose of the ViewChild decorator in this component class?

- [x] It provides access from within the component class to the ElementRef object for the `<p>` tag that has the bio template reference variable in the component's template view.
- [ ] It indicates that the `<p>` tag be rendered as a child of the parent view that uses this component.
- [ ] It makes the `<p>` tag in the template support content projection.
- [ ] It makes the `<p>` tag visible in the final render. If the #bio was used in the template and the @ViewChild was not used in the class, then Angular would automatically hide the `<p>` tag that has #bio on it.

#### Q4. Based on the following usage of the async pipe, and assuming the users class field is an Observable, how many subscriptions to the users Observable are being made?

- [ ] None. The async pipe does not subscribe automatically.
- [ ] None. The template syntax is not correct.
- [x] Three. There is one for each async pipe.
- [ ] One. The async pipe caches Observables by type internally.

#### Q11. What is the purpose of the valueChanges method on a FormControl?
- [ ] It is used to change the value of a control to a new value. You would call that method and pass in the new value for the form field. It even supports passing in an array of values that can be set over time.
- [ ] It returns a Boolean based on if the value of the control is different from the value with which it was initialized.
- [x] It is an observable that emits every time the value of the control changes, so you can react to new values and make logic decisions at that time.

#### Q14. What is the difference between these two markup examples for conditionally handling display?
- [ ] The `ngIf` is shorthand for the other example. When Angular processes that directive, it writes a div element to the DOM with the hidden property.
- [ ] They are fundamentally the same.
- [x] The `ngIf` directive does not render the div in the DOM if the expression is false. The `hidden` property usage hides the div content in the browser viewport, but the div is still in the DOM.
- [ ] The `ngIf` is valid, but the use of the `hidden` property is wrong and will throw an error.

[Angular.io - Lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)

#### Q19. Pick the best description for this template syntax code:

- [ ] The ? is shorthand for the async pipe. The job value must be an Observable.
- [x] It is using the safe navigation operator (?) on the job field. If the job field is undefined, the access to the bossName will be ignored and no error will occur.
- [ ] There is an error in the template syntax. The ? is not valid here.
- [ ] It is diplaying the job value if it has one; otherwise it is displaying the bossName.

- [ ] `{ url: 'user/:id', routedComponent: UserDetailComponent }`
- [ ] `{ routedPath: 'user/:id', component: UserDetailComponent }`
- [ ] `{ destination: new UserDetailComponent(), route: 'user/:id' }`

[CodeCraft - Parameterised Routes](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/routing/parameterised-routes/#_configuration)

#### Q21. What are the HostListener decorators and the HostBinding decorator doing in this directive?

- [x] They are setting the CalloutDirective.fontWeight field based on whether or not the mouse is over the DOM element. The HostListener then sets the font-weight CSS property to the fontWeight value.
- [ ] They are setting up the directive to check the DOM element that it is on. If it has event bindings added for mouse enter and leave it will use this code. Otherwise nothing will happen.
- [ ] This is an incorrect use of HostListener and HostBinding. The HostListener and HostBinding decorators do not do anything on directives; they work only when used on components.
- [ ] If the DOM element that this directive is placed on has the CSS property font-weight set on it, the mouseenter and mouseleave events will get raised.

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/angular-hostbinding-hostlistener)

#### Q22. What Angular template syntax can you use on this template-driven form field to access the field value and check for validation within the template markup?

- [x] You can make use of a template reference variable and the exportAs feature that the ngModel directive has.
- [ ] You can use the ngModel directive in combination with the input field name.
- [ ] You can use a template reference variable for the HTML input element and then check the valid property off of that.
- [ ] It is not possible to get access to the field value with template-driven forms. You must use reactive forms for that.

[Medium](https://medium.com/@agoiabeladeyemi/template-driven-forms-in-angular-4a3a5ad960de)

#### Q23. What is the value type that will be stored in the headerText template reference variable in this markup?

- [x] an Angular ElementRef, a wrapper around a native element
- [ ] the inner text of the `<h1>` element
- [ ] a header component class
- [ ] the native DOM element type of HTMLHeadingElement

#### Q24. What is the difference, if any, of the resulting code logic based on these two provider configurations?

- [ ] They are the same. Both will result in a new instance of Logger that is bound to the FormattedLogger token.
- [x] The useClass syntax tells the injector to make a new instance of Logger and bind that instance to the FormattedLogger token. The useExisting syntax refers to an already existing object instance declared as Logger.
- [ ] Both of them are wrong. A strong type connot be used for useClass or useExisting.
- [ ] They are the same. Both will result in the FormattedLogger token being an alias for the instance of Logger.

#### Q25. What is the purpose of the data property (seen in the example below) in a route configuration?

- [ ] a key/value mapping for setting @Input values on the routed component instance
- [x] a way to include static, read-only data associated with the route that can be retrieved from the ActivatedRoute
- [ ] a property on the route that can be used to load dynamic data for the route
- [ ] an object that will get auto-injected into the routed component's constructor.

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36835156)

#### Q26. How does the built-in `ngIf` structural directive change the rendered DOM based on this template syntax?

- [ ] It produces an error, since ngIf is not a built-in structural directive.
- [x] If the product class field is "truthy," then the rendered DOM will include the `<div>` with the value of the `product.name` field. If it is not "truthy,' the rendered DOM will not contain the `<div>` element.

[Reference (angular.io)](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf)

#### Q27. What does this code accomplish?

- [x] It declares an Angular module named AppModule that contains a bootstrapped component named AppComponent. Then it registers that module with Angular, so the app can start up.

[Angular.io - The basic NgModule](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodules#the-basic-ngmodule)

#### Q28. Which choice best describes what the _resolve_ property does in this route configuration?
- [x] Prior to loading the _UserComponent_, the router will subscribe to the _Observable_ returned by a _resolve_ method in the _UserResolverService_. This technique can be used to get preloaded data for a _route_.
- [ ] After the _route_ is done resolving, and the component is loaded and rendered, the _UserResolverService_ will have a method named _user_ run that will clean up any open data connections.
- [ ] There is an error. The correct property name is _onResolve_.
- [ ] The _UserComponent_ will have a parameter in its constructor for _user_, and the _router_ will handle injecting in a value for that from a call to a _user_ method in the _UserResolverService_.

[angular.io](https://angular.io/api/router/Resolve)

#### Q29. What is the purpose of the ContentChildren decorator in this component class?
- [ ] If any _TabsComponent_ elements are added to the _TabsListComponent_ template, they will get put into the <ng-content> element at runtime.
- [ ] It creates _TabComponent_ components in the _TabsListComponent_ template when a _TabsListComponent_ is instantiated.
- [x] It provides access from within the component class to any _TabComponent_ components that were content projected into the <ng-content> for this component.
- [ ] It restricts the allowed elements that can be put into a _TabsListComponent_ element to allow only _TabComponent_ elements.

[betterprogramming.pub](https://betterprogramming.pub/understanding-contentchildren-with-an-example-e76ce78968db)

#### Q30. In order for Angular to process components in an application, where do the component types need to be registered?

- [ ] within a script tag in the index.html file
- [ ] in an NgModule decorator metadata tag named _components_
- [ ] No registration is needed simply include the component files in an app directory.
- [x] in an NgModule decorator metadata property named _declarations_

[angular.io](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule-api#ngmodule-metadata)

#### Q31. What is the purpose of the `fixture.detectChanges()` call in this unit test?

- [ ] It tracks any potential Ul changes and will fail the unit test if any are made.
- [ ] It is used to ensure component template stability across multiple unit tests in the entire test suite.
- [x] It forces Angular to perform change detection, which will render the _UserCardComponent_ before you can validate its template.
- [ ] It is used to log change-detection events to the console during unit test runs.

[angular.io](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/ComponentFixture#detectChanges)

#### Q32. What will the URL segment look like based on the following call to the `Router.navigate` method when goToUser is passed the value 15?

- [x] /user/15
- [ ] /user?id=15
- [ ] /user:15
- [ ] /user;id=15

[angular.io](https://angular.io/api/router/Router#navigate)

#### Q33. When a service is provided for root and is also added to the provider's configuration for a lazy-loaded module, what instance of that service does the injector provide to constructors in the lazy-loaded module?

- [x] A new instance of that service is created when the module is lazy loaded.
- [ ] Providing a service of the same type at a lazy-loaded module level is not allowed.
- [ ] If an instance of the service has not been created at the root level yet. it will create one there and then use it.
- [ ] A single instance of that service is always instantiated at root and is the only one ever used, including within lazy modules.

#### Q34. What is the HostBinding decorator doing in this directive?

- [x] It is adding the CSS class named highlighted to any DOM element that has the appHighlight directive on it.
- [ ] HostBinding does not do anything on directives, only on components.
- [ ] It is specifying if the host element gets the highlighted class added to its class attribute, then the directive class field highlight will get set to true; and if it is not added on the host it will get set to false.
- [ ] It is creating an inline style on the host element with a CSS property named highlight set to true.

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46207423)

#### Q35. In reactive forms, what Angular form class type is used on the native DOM <form> element to wire it up?

#### Q37. How does the emulated view encapsulation mode handle CSS for a component?

- [ ] It renders the CSS exactly how you wrote it without any changes.
- [ ] It makes use of shadow DOM markup and CSS.
- [x] It creates unique attributes for DOM elements and scopes the CSS selectors you write to those attribute ids.
- [ ] It renders all of the CSS rules you write as inline CSS on all of the DOM elements you use them on in the template.

[Angular.io](https://angular.io/guide/view-encapsulation#inspecting-generated-css)

#### Q38. With the following TestBed setup, what can be used to access the rendered DOM for the UserCardComponent?

#### Q42. Which choice best describes the following usage of the HttpClient . get method in the getsettings class method?
- [ ] Every single call to the getSettings method will result in the Httpclient making three total get requests to the settingsUrl, which is not ideal because there will always be two extra calls that are not needed. The retry operator should not be used in this manner.
- [x] When the result of the getSettings method is subscribed to, the HTTP GET call will be made; if it fails, it will be retried up to three times before it gives up and returns an error.

#### Q43. When a service requires some setup to initialize its default state through a method, how can you make sure that said method is invoked before the service gets injected anywhere?

- [ ] Put the logic of that service method into the service constructor instead.
- [x] Use a factory provider at the root AppModule level that depends on the service to call that service method.
- [ ] it is not possible to do it at application start; you can do it only at a component level.
- [ ] Instantiate an instance of the service at the global level (window scope) and then call that method.

#### Q44. What statement best describes this usage of the TestBed?
- [ ] The TestBed is required anytime you want to make use of a spy object in a unit test for an Angular provider.
- [ ] The TestBed is being used to test a component's view.
- [x] The TestBed scaffolds an NgModule with two providers and handles any dependeny injection. If any Angular class requests the DataService in its constructor, the TestBed will inject spy in that constructor.
- [ ] The TestBed is configuring the test runner to tell it to only execute tests for the two providers listed in its providers array.
- `All other tests be ignored, including tests that assert results against one of these providers and a non-defined provider.`
  `Although it will work when multiple providers in this configuration are asserted against in a single test.`

#### Q45. What is the primary difference between a component and a directive?

- [ ] A component uses a selector metadata property and a directive does not.
- [ ] A directive can be used for adding custom events to the DOM and a component cannot.
- [x] A component has a template and a directive does not.
- [ ] A directive can target only native DOM elements.

#### Q48. Assuming the `DataService` has been registered in the providers for the application, which answer best describes what happens based on this component's constructor?
- [ ] It is declaring that the `OrderHistoryComponent` will have its own version of a `DataService` and that it should never use any existing instances. The `DataService` would need to be instantiated within the class as a private field for this code to be complete and working.
- [x] When Angular creates a new instance of the `OrderHistoryComponent`, the injector will provide an instance of a `DataService` class to the component constructor's first argument. The constructor's `dataService` parameter will be used to set a private instance field with the same name on the instance.
- [ ] It provides a way to do component testing only; the constructor has no usage in the actual run of the Angular application.
- [ ] It enables the custom element that the component targets to have a custom property named `dataService` that can be used to bind an existing `DataService` instance to.

#### Q51. Describe how the validation is set up and configured in this reactive forms example:
- [ ] The `FormControl` for `username` is getting configured to exclude three validators from the validators that it is allowed to use.
- [ ] The `FormControl` for `username` is getting configured to allow three possible validators to be used: `required, maxLength`, and a custom one named `unique`. To enable these `validators`, a validator directive would need to be put on the form fields in the markup.
- [ ] Validation cannot be set up this way in reactive forms.
- [x] The `FormControl` for `username` is getting configured with three validators: the `required` and `minLength` validators that come from Angular, and a custom validator function named `unique` that checks for the value not equal to the string `admin`.

#### Q52. What does the Injectable decorator do on this service class?

- [ ] It registers a provider for the service that is available only at the root module level, not to any children modules.
- [x] It registers a provider for the service in the root application injector, making a single instance of it available throughout the application.

- [ ] Check the routing tables for the VPC.
- [x] Verify that the assigned security groups allow TCP port 1433 traffic from your current IP address.
- [ ] Check the policies within Windows Firewall.
- [ ] Verify that you are connecting to the instance using a user that is not sa.

#### Q22. You are hosting an application configured to stream media to its clients on TCP ports 3380-3384, 3386-3388, and 3390. The Inbound tab below shows three incoming security group policies attached to this instance. Which policy should you use?

- [x] The rule that exposes TCP ports 3380-3390 would also publicly expose port 3389 (RDP) to the entire internet. Write separate rules to only expose the needed ports.
- [ ] The first security group rule allows all traffic into this instance. Exposing your entire instance to the whole internet leaves the server open to various attacks of the other services running on different port numbers.
- [ ] Verify that the AWS account owners actually control the entire CIDR C block for 12.228.11.0-255 and these are secured IPs for RDP access into this instance.
- [ ] There are no recommendations to make.

#### Q23. You have four front-end web servers behind a load balancer, which use NFS to access another EC2 instance that resizes and stores images for the front-end application. What security group policies should be assigned to these servers?

- [x] Front-end web servers should allow HTTPS. Assign another group to all of the instances that allows all traffic to pass between instances using that group.
- [ ] Create a security group that allows inbound NFS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses. Apply this group to all of the servers.
- [ ] Create a security group that allows inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses and apply this to the web servers. Create a second security group for the NFS filestore that allows outbound NFS traffic to the private IP range of the front-end web servers.

#### Q24. You have a Linux EC2 web server that suddenly is timing out on all HTTP requests and your SSH connection attempts are timing out. You notice that it is failing the system status check in the EC2 console. What action should you take?

- [x] Restore the instance from the last AMI image. System status checks indicate that the filesystem on the instance is corrupted.
- [ ] Stop and start the instance. This will move the instance to another host.
- [ ] Contact AWS support. Failing a system status check indicates a failure in the underlying hardware and must be addressed by an AWS representative.
- [ ] Reboot the instance. This will stop and start the instance and move it to another host.

#### Q25. You have several on-premise servers and would like to store your offsite backups on AWS. What fully managed backup service can you use to ship your backups to AWS?

#### Q26. What is the best practice for creating a highly available PostgreSQL database in RDS that can sustain the loss of a single AWS region?
- [ ] Verify that your instance is configured for Multi-AZ support. Database changes will be automatically synced to another region in the event of a failure and RDS will automatically select a new master until the regional failure is resolved.
- [x] Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. Ensure read operations against the database occur on an available Read Replica, and send write operations to another region if you need to promote a Read Replica to a standalone database if the master is down.

#### Q27. You created a new Linux EC2 instance and installed PostgreSQL but you are not able to establish a connection to the server from your local computer. What steps do you take to resolve this issue?

- [ ] Create a security group rule that allows all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. This will verify whether or not another rule is denying the traffic.
- [x] Verify that the assigned security groups allow traffic from your IP address to port 5432. Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external traffic and is bound to the public interface.
- [ ] Make sure that you are using an Elastic IP and that it is included within the `postgresql.conf` configuration file.
- [ ] Stop and start the instance. New security group rules will only take effect after a restart.

#### Q28. What does the statement body of this S3 bucket policy do?


- [x] bucketpolicy1 allows any user coming from the IP range of 68.249.108.0 to 68.249.108.255 to access objects in the userreports bucket-except anyone coming from the IP of 68.249.108.128.

#### Q29. A new developer has been added to the team and you have been asked to provide access to the organization's AWS account. What is the best practice for granting access?
- [ ] Create a IAM user for the new developer. Manually assign policies to the new IAM user account.
- [ ] Do not give the new developer access to the AWS console. Using the IAM user that is assigned to the development group, generate a new set of access keys and label these with the name of the developer.
- [x] Create a IAM user for the new developer. Assign the new developer the a developer group you already created for the other developers.

#### Q30. When launching an EC2 instance with an instance type that supports instance storage, what use case is best for instance storage?

- [x] Use the instance storage to serve temporary files that require low I/O latency.
- [ ] Use the instance storage to handle files uploaded by your users. Since it is more secure than an EBS volume, you can isolate any malicious files from infecting your server.
- [ ] Instance storage is faster than EBS volumes, so install the root of the operating system on this volume to speed up server performance.
- [ ] Instance storage is a deprecated option for storage and should not be used.

#### Q31. What's the best practice for horizontally scaling a legacy ASP.NET web application that relies on Active Directory and is currently deployed to a single Windows EC2 instance?

- [x] Use Sysprep to shut down the instance during a maintenance window. Create an AMI image and place both servers behind Application Load Balancer with sticky sessions.
- [ ] Launch a new EC2 with the latest version of Windows Server and install the application again. Use Application Load Balancer and sticky sessions to balance between both servers.
- [ ] Create a clone of the server using an AMI image and user Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic between both instances using sticky sessions.
- [ ] Horizontal scaling is not the best practice in this situation. Increase the size of the existing EC2 instance and vertically scale the application.

#### Q32. What does this small section of a CloudFormation template do?
- [x] It writes the VPC network flow logs to the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup log group. You could use this to inspect the network connections of your VPC.
- [ ] It logs all of the network traffic within a VPC except Instance IDs defined by LogVpcID and logs it to the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup log group.
- [ ] It logs all the network traffic going to and from a single EC2 instance into the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup log group. You could use this to inspect suspicious network traffic coming into an EC2 instance.
- [ ] It logs all of the DNS requests made by resources within a VPC and logs them to the CloudWatch FlowLogsGroup. Use this to diagnose DNS lookup errors within your environment.

- [x] The database instance will report a STORAGE_FULL status and become inaccessible if the instance does not have enough remaining storage to operate. Allocate more space to the instance.
- [ ] SQL Server will close all existing connections to the databases and attempt to shrink its log files to reclaim storage space.
- [ ] RDS will automatically increase the allocated space by 5% and will continue to allocate new space up to 50% of the orginal allocated space. When storage space has increase 50%, RDS will automatically stop the instance to preserve data integrity.

#### Q54. You have a fleet of IoT devices that send telemetry to a server-side application provided by your IoT vendor for decoding a proprietary messaging format. The devices are provisioned to send telemetry reports to your server via UDP on port 6339. What is the best way scale this server as more Iot devices are added to your fleet?
- [ ] Use a Network Load Balancer to distribute the traffic across your servers. Use UDP health checks to determine if the server is available to receive traffic.
- [x] Use Route 53 with HTTP health checks. Create an application on the server to report the readiness status of the vendor-provided server software to Route 53 via HTTP.
- [ ] Use Route 53 with UDP health checks. As you scale up, Route 53 wiwll route the traffic to the new servers if they pass the health checks.
- [ ] Use Application Load Balancer to distribute the traffic across your servers.

#### Q55. the outbound rules of a security group only allow traffic going to 0.0.0.0/0 on TCP Port 22 (SSH) and TCP port 3306 (MySQL). Review the inbound rules listed in the image below. What is the most important issue to fix with this security group configuration, for an Ubuntu EC2 instance acting as a web server?
- [ ] The outbound rules block UDP port 53, so the server will not be able to resolve any DNS lookups.
- [x] The outbound rules do not allow for HTTP traffic to leave the instance, so inbound HTTP requests will fail because the clients will never get HTTP responses.
- [ ] The incoming SSH port should not be open to the public. Limit SSH to a single IP address or IP range of controlled addressed, or use a VPN to access the VPC for this server.
- [ ] The all incoming TCP ports are exposed, which overrides the HTTP and SSH rules and exposes all TCP ports to the public internet.

```

#### Q64. What is wrong with the third incoming security group rule, which allows all traffic from sg-269afc5e to go to an Ubuntu EC2 instance configured as a web server?
- [ ] All traffic on all ports is being denied into this instance, which overwrites the HTTP rule and makes it redundant.
- [x] The instance was launched with the default security group, but there is no way for an administrator to SSH into the instance.
      Add another rule that allows for SSH access from a secured source, such as a single IP or a range of managed IP addresses.
- [ ] There is nothing wrong with this security group rule. Assuming that sg-269afc5e is applied to other resources that are properly
      secured, this rule allows all traffic to pass through that is also assigned security group sg-269afc5e.
- [ ] All traffic on all ports are allowed into this instance. This exposes the instance to all public internet traffic and
      overwrites the incoming HTTP rule.

#### Q75. You have an analytics suite that produces reports about the usage patterns of your web application. After completing your migration to AWS and using Application Load Balancer to balance the load across your web application, your marketing department noticed that location-based reports on the web traffic only show traffic originating from a single location. What is the problem?
- [ ] Use a Classic Load Balancer, not Application Load Balancer.
- [x] Application Load Balancer does not preserve the original source IP address. The analytics software needs to be configured to look at the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP request header for the correct source IP address.
- [ ] Application Load Balencer has to be configured to retain the source IP address of the traffic it is forwarding. Create a policy that enables ProxyProtocol support and attach it to the ALB using the AWS CLI.
- [ ] Configure the web server EC2 instances to only have private IP addresses. The public IP addresses of the instances are being recorded into the web server logs, bug only ALB should have a public interface and it will route traffic to instances via the private interface.

- [x] Create a second virtual private gateway (VPG) and attach it to the VPC. Create a customer gateway for the new virtual private gateway and use your VPN client at your second data center to establish a connection to the VPG.
- [ ] You can not have more than one customer gateway per VPC, so the proposed solution will not work. Create a second VPC with a virtual private gateway and a customer gateway. Bridge the two VPCs using VPC peering.

#### Q81. You are migrating a 200 GB database from an on-premise SQL Server to RDS for SQL Server. The database needs to have minimal downtime during the migration. What is the best practice for migrating this database?

- [ ] An email will be sent to the email address on file. After clicking in the link in your email, provide one of the MFA recovery codes that were created when MFA was enabled.
- [ ] Use the AWS CLI with the root account access token to disable MFA on the root account. Then use the CLI to set a new password on the root account.

[Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_lost-or-broken.html)

#### Q83. How do you assign an Elastic IP to several EC2 instances?

[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54742522/assign-multiple-ec2-instances-to-one-elastic-ip)

#### Q84. You created a VPC that has a public subnet and a private subnet. A web server was placed in the public subnet and a database server was placed in the private subnet. The web server is able to connect to the database server; however, the database server at 10.0.1.2 is unable to get software updates. What is the cause of this issue?

- [x] There is no NAT gateway for the private subnet, so the database server has no routes that give it public internet access to download software updates.
- [ ] The database server needs to be assigned a public address from the pool, or assigned an Elastic IP similar to the instance 10.0.0.2.
- [ ] The router is not configured properly on the VPC. Add a route to route table for the VPC that routes all traffic for 0.0.0.0/0 to the ID of the internet gateway.

#### Q5. Which of the following is a true statement about the difference between pointers and iterators?
- [ ] While pointers are variable that hold memory address, iterators are generic functions used to traverse containers. These function allows the programmer to implement read and write code as the container is traversed.
- [x] Incrementing an iterator always means access the next element in the container(if any), no matter the container. Incrementing the pointer means pointing to the next element in memory, not always the next element.
- [ ] Pointers are variables that hold memory address where as iterator are unsigned integers that refers to offsets in arrays.
- [ ] All iterator are implemented with pointers so all iterators are pointers but not all pointers are iterators.

[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31128162)

#### Q6. What's a benefit of declaring the parameter as a const reference instead of declaring it as a regular object?
- [ ] The argument is passed as a reference, so the function receives a copy that can be modified without affecting the original value.
- [x] The argument is passed as a reference, so if the passed my_array object is large, the program will require less time and memory.
- [ ] Actually objects can't be passed as regular variables because they require a constructor call. Therefore a const reference is the only way to pass class instances to functions.
- [ ] There are no benefits because a reference and an object are treated as the same thing.

- [ ] Error
- [ ] `*v1:{1,2,3,4}; *v2:{1,2,3,5};`

v1 and v2 point to the same vector.

#### Q10. Which of the following is not a difference between a class and a struct?

- [ ] Because structs are part of the C programming language, there are some complexity between C and C++ structs. This is not the case with classes.
- [x] Classes may have member functions; structs are private.
- [ ] The default access specifier for members of struct is public, whereas for member of class, it is private.
- [ ] Template type parameters can be declared with classes, but not with the struct keyword.

- [x] A
```cpp
i=1;
while(i<10){
    cout<<++i<<endl;}
```


#### Q38. What does this part of a main.cpp file do?


- [x] It causes the replacement of the `#include` directive by the entire contents of the source file library.h. This is similar to a Copy-Paste operation of library.h into main.cpp.

#undef MY_LIBRARY_H
```

#### Q41. What's wrong with this definition when using a pre-C++11 compiler?
- [ ] There's nothing wrong with it.
- [ ] An `std::vector` cannot contain more `std::vector` containers as its elements.
- [ ] The correct syntax should be: `std::vector[std::vector[int]] thematrix;`
- [x] `>>` is parsed as the shift-right operator, and thus results in a compile error.

```
#### Q44. What is the result from executing this code snippet?
- [ ] Part A executes because the expression `(~x || y)` always results in true if `y==false`.
- [ ] Part B executes because the statement `(~x || y)` is invalid, thus false.
- [ ] Part A executes because `~x` is not zero, meaning true.
- [x] Part B executes because `~x` is false and `y` is false, thus the `OR` operation evaluates as false.

- [x] `std::map`

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map)

#### Q48. What does this program do?
- [ ] It renames text1.txt to text2.txt.
- [ ] It makes a directory called text2.txt and moves text1.txt there.
- [x] It copies the contents of text1.txt into text2.txt - i.e., it makes a copy of text1.txt, named text2.txt.
- [ ] It appends the contents of text1.txt into text2.txt - i.e., replaces the contents of text2.txt by the concatenation of text2.txt and text1.txt.

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/fstream)

#### Q49. Which of the following is _not_ a consequence of declaring the member variable count of my_class as static?

- [x] The variable cannot be modified by any part of the code in the same application or thread. However, other threads may modify it.
- [ ] The variable exists even when no objects of the class have been defined so it can be modified at any point in the source code.
- [ ] The variable is allocated only once, regardless of how many objects are instantiated because it is bound to the class itself, not its instances.
- [ ] All objects that try to access their count member variable actually refer to the only class-bound static count variable.

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static)

- [ ] `grades.count();`
- [ ] `my_array->count();`
- [x] `grades->count();`
- [ ] `my_array.count();`

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_member_access)

#### Q54. What would be the output of this code?
- [x] There is no output. The code causes a compiler error because `nums` is an array of references, which is illegal.
- [ ] 846
- [ ] The output is the addresses of `i2`, `i0`, and `i1`, in that order, with no spaces.
- [ ] 468

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array)

#### Q55. Does this code cause a compiler error? If so, why, and if not, what is `child_t`?
- [ ] Yes, it causes a compiler error because the colon character is not allowed in struct definitions.
- [x] and `child_t` is a type defined as a structure with bit fields. It has 4 bits for age and 1 bit for gender in the first byte, and 2 bits for size in the second byte.
- [ ] Yes, it causes a compiler error because there is an unnamed field.
- [ ] Yes, it causes a compiler error because one field is defined as having a size of 0.

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/bit_field)

```

- [ ] D

```cpp
lambda(uint32_t a, uint32_t b){
    return a < b;

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex/try_lock)

#### Q64. What is one benefit of declaring the parameter as a `const` reference instead of declaring it as a regular object?
- [ ] There are no benefits because a reference and an object are treated as the same thing.
- [x] The `const` qualifier Forbids the code to modify the argument, so the programmer can rest assured that the source object will remain unchanged.
- [ ] The argument is passed as a reference, so the Function receives a copy that can be modified without affecting the original variable.

Note: This one is similar to Q6, but focuses on the `const` keyword.

#### Q65. What is an include guard?
- [ ] a preprocessor directive that prevents inconsistent behaviors in lines that contain the #ifdef, #ifndef, or #elif directives
- [ ] a compiler option that prevents the user code from including additional libraries

- [ ] Yes, it causes a compiler error because there is an unnamed field.
- [ ] Yes, it causes a compiler error because one field is defined as having a size of 0.

[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/bit_field)

#### Q72. Which choice is a reason to specify the type of a pointer instead of using `void *`, which works as a pointer ro any type?

- [x] The compiler needs the data type to know how much memory to allocate for the pointer, because different data types require different pointer lengths.

If the LinkedIn assessment asks this and you can choose just one option, then leave feedback.

#### Q3. Describe what these Git commands do to the commit history:

- [ ] They reset the HEAD to the fifth commit in the repo, then merge to the master branch.
- [x] The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.
- [ ] They delete the last five commits.
- [ ] They merge the last five commits into a new branch.

**Explanation:**

- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.
- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.

#### Q4. Your current project has several branches; master, beta, and push-notifications. You've just finished the notification feature in the push-notification branch, and you want to commit it to beta branch. How can you accomplish this?

- [ ] Checkout the push-notifications branch and run git merge beta
- [ ] Checkout the master branch and run git merge beta -> push-notification

#### Q6. What will the following command print to the Terminal?

- [x] A list of remote repositories and their URLs
- [ ] The current git version you're running
- [ ] An inline editor for modifying remote repositories
- [ ] The last 5 git versions you've installed

#### Q7. Looking at the following commands, describe what is happening.

- [ ] The commit is being tagged for release on the feature-user-location branch
- [ ] A commit is being copied from its original branch over to the feature-user-location branch
- [x] The commit is being cherry picked as the new HEAD of the commit history
- [ ] A commit is being copied from the feature-user-location branch to the master branch
- [ ] The branch is switched to the feature-user-location branch, and the specified commit is applied to the branch.

**Explanation:** Commits aren't copied when cherry picking, they are cherry picked. The changes introduced by the commit are applied and a new commit is then created. This allow us to get specific changes as if they were patches (in the GIT's book, this is actually called [Patching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Patching "See this in the GIT's book")). As a new commit is created upon feature-user-location, HEAD also changes to match it. You can see this in `cat .git/HEAD` and `cat .git/refs/heads/feature-user-location` for this case. See `man git-cherry-pick` for details.

**NOTE**: There are two versions of this question so far. The task is always "describe what is happening", the commands are always a `checkout` and a `cherry-pick`, and the correct answer is always the same.

#### Q8. What does the following command do to the git repository?

- [ ] It deletes all previous commits and reset the repository history back to its initial state.
- [ ] It resets the working branch to the first commit.
- [ ] It keeps the HEAD at the current commit, but clears all previous commits.
- [x] It sets HEAD to the previous commit and leaves changes from the undone commit in the stage/index.

#### Q9. You find a bug in your project, but can't locate where it was introduced in the commit history. How would you diagnose this problem?

- [ ] Manually backtrack through your commit history.
- [ ] Use git search -diff to compare all commits in your repository history.
- [ ] Run a git rebase to find the buggy commit.
- [x] Use git bisect to compare the buggy commit to an early commit that works as expected.

#### Q10. Why would the following command be used?

- [ ] To run a comparative search of the last 10 commits for differences
- [x] To list the last 10 commits and modify them with either the squash or fixup command
- [ ] To delete the last 10 commits and reset the HEAD
- [ ] In order to locally cache the last 10 commits

#### Q11. Why would you use a pre-receive hook in your remote repository?

- [ ] You wouldn't, you would use it in the local repository

#### Q15. How can you display a list of files added or modified in a specific commit?

- [ ] Find the commit in the remote repository, as that's the only place that kind of information is stored.
- [x] Use the `diff-tree` command with the commit hash.
- [ ] Run `git commit --info` with the commit hash.
- [ ] Access the commit stash data with `git stash`.

#### Q16. What files is this .gitignore programmed to leave out?

- [ ] All files with a .swift, .txt, or metadata file extension, as well as the entire build directory
- [ ] Only the build directory
- [x] All files in the build directory, as well as files ending with .txt or .metadata
- [ ] Only files with .swift and .txt extensions.

A line starting with `#` serves as a comment. Hence `# .swift` does not do anything. See `man gitignore`.

#### Q17. After you make changes to a local repository, you run the following command. What will this do?

- [ ] Nothing, you can't use multiple options in the same command
- [ ] Adds all new files to the staging area

- [ ] The default behavior is case sensitive, but it can be overridden.

[encoding/json#Unmarshal](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Unmarshal)

Relevant excerpt from the article:

> _To unmarshal JSON into a struct, Unmarshal matches incoming object keys to the keys used by Marshal (either the struct field name or its tag), preferring an exact match but also accepting a case-insensitive match. By default, object keys which don't have a corresponding struct field are ignored (see Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields for an alternative)._

#### Q23. What is the difference between the `time` package’s `Time.Sub()` and `Time.Add()` methods?

- [ ] Time.Add() is for performing addition while Time.Sub() is for nesting timestamps.

[Example of Recover Function in Go (Golang)](https://golangbot.com/panic-and-recover/#recoveringfromapanic)

Relevant excerpt from the article:

> _Recover is useful only when called inside deferred functions. Executing a call to recover inside a deferred function stops the panicking sequence by restoring normal execution and retrieves the error message passed to the panic function call. If recover is called outside the deferred function, it will not stop a panicking sequence._

#### Q26. Which choice does _not_ send output to standard error?

#### Q29. Which encodings can you put in a string?

- [ ] any, it accepts arbitary bytes
- [ ] any Unicode format
- [ ] UTF-8 or ASCII
- [x] UTF-8

[Example of encoding in Go (Golang)](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/encoding)

Relevant excerpt from the article:

> _Package encoding defines an interface for character encodings, such as Shift JIS and Windows 1252, that can convert to and from UTF-8._

#### Q30. How is the behavior of `t.Fatal` different inside a `t.Run`?

- [ ] There is no difference.
- [ ] t.Fatal does not crash the test harness, preserving output messages.
- [x] t.Fatal stops execution of the subtest and continues with other test cases.
- [ ] t.Fatal stops all tests and contains extra information about the failed subtest.

[Reference:](https://go.dev/play/p/gtne3iRL9AX)

Explanation:  
Fatal is equivalent to Log followed by FailNow.  
Log formats its arguments using default formatting, analogous to Println, and records the text in the error log.  
FailNow marks the function as having failed and stops its execution by calling runtime.Goexit (which then runs all deferred calls in the current goroutine). Execution will continue at the next test or benchmark. FailNow must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function, not from other goroutines created during the test. Calling FailNow does not stop those other goroutines.  
Run runs f as a subtest of t called name. It runs f in a separate goroutine and blocks until f returns or calls t.Parallel to become a parallel test. Run reports whether f succeeded (or at least did not fail before calling t.Parallel).  
Run may be called simultaneously from multiple goroutines, but all such calls must return before the outer test function for t returns.

#### Q31. What does `log.Fatal` do?

- [ ] It raises a panic.
- [ ] It prints the log and then raises a panic.
- [x] It prints the log and then safely exits the program.
- [ ] It exits the program.

[Example of func Fatal in Go (Golang)](https://pkg.go.dev/log#Fatal)

Relevant excerpt from the article:

> _Fatal is equivalent to Print() followed by a call to os.Exit(1)._

#### Q32. Which is a valid Go time format literal?

- [x] "2006-01-02"
- [ ] "YYYY-mm-dd"
- [ ] "y-mo-d"
- [ ] "year-month-day"

[Example of func Time in Go (Golang)](https://pkg.go.dev/time)

Relevant excerpt from the article:

> _Most programs can use one of the defined constants as the layout passed to Format or Parse. The rest of this comment can be ignored unless you are creating a custom layout string._

#### Q33. How should you log an error (err)

- [ ] `log.Error(err)`
- [x] `log.Printf("error: %v", err)`
- [ ] `log.Printf(log.ERROR, err)`
- [ ] `log.Print("error: %v", err)`

Explanation: There is defined neither log.ERROR, nor log.Error() in [log package](https://pkg.go.dev/log); log.Print() arguments are handled in the manner of fmt.Print(); log.Printf() arguments are handled in the manner of fmt.Printf().

#### Q34. How does a `sync.Mutex` block while it is locked?

`<input> elements of type hidden let web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. For example, the ID of the content that is currently being ordered or edited, or a unique security token. Hidden inputs are completely invisible in the rendered page, and there is no way to make it visible in the page's content.` [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden)

- [ ] The computer must stop the 5-volt signal to media, otherwise the drive may short.

#### Q1. Given the string "strawberries" saved in a variable called fruit, what would `fruit.substring(2, 5)` return?

- [ ] rawb
- [x] raw
- [ ] awb
- [ ] traw

**Reasoning:** The substring method is accepting two arguments.

- The first argument being the index to start(includes that char at 2)
- and the second the index of the string to end the substring(excludes the char at 5).
- Strings in Java are like arrays of chars.
- Therefore, the method will return "raw" as those are the chars in indexes 2,3, and 4.
- You can also take the ending index and subtract the beginning index from it, to determine how many chars will be included in the substring (5-2=3).

- [ ] "-123"
- [ ] It will throw an exception on line 5.
- [x] "123"

**Explanation:** The answer is "123". The `abs()` method evaluates to the one inside mypackage.Math class, because The import statements of the form:

`import packageName.subPackage.*`

is [Type-Import-on-Demand Declarations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.5.2), which [never causes any other declaration to be shadowed](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.4.1).

#### Q11. What is the result of this code?

- [x] It will not compile because of line 10.
- [ ] "Hello!"
- [ ] It will not compile because of line 2.
- [ ] "World!"

**Explanation:** Compilation error at line 10 because of final methods cannot be overridden, and here message() is a final method, and also note that Non-static method message() cannot be referenced from a static context.

#### Q12. Given this code, which command will output "2"?

- [ ] `java Main 1 2 "3 4" 5`
- [x] `java Main 1 "2" "2" 5`

#### Q17. You have an ArrayList of names that you want to sort alphabetically. Which approach would **NOT** work?

- [ ] `names.sort(Comparator.comparing(String::toString))`
- [ ] `Collections.sort(names)`
- [x] `names.sort(List.DESCENDING)`
- [ ] `names.stream().sorted((s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2)).collect(Collectors.toList())`

- [ ] You don't have to decide the type of an ArrayList when you first make it.

#### Q56. Declare a variable that holds the first four digits of Π

- [ ] int pi = 3.141;
- [ ] decimal pi = 3.141;
- [x] double pi = 3.141;
- [ ] float pi = 3.141;

**Reasoning:**

```java
public class TestReal {
    public static void main (String[] argv)
    {
      double pi = 3.14159265;       //accuracy up to 15 digits
      float pi2 = 3.141F;           //accuracy up to 6-7 digits

      System.out.println ("Pi=" + pi);
      System.out.println ("Pi2=" + pi2);
    }
  }
```

```
The default Java type which Java will be using for a float variable will be double.
So, even if you declare any variable as float, what the compiler has to actually do is to assign a double value to a float variable,
which is not possible. So, to tell the compiler to treat this value as a float, that 'F' is used.
```

- [x] `/\d\d:\d\d:\d\d/`
- [ ] `/[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+/`
- [ ] `/ : : /`

NOTE: The first three are all partially correct and will match digits, but the **second option is the most correct** because it will **only** match **2 digit** time values (12:00:32). The first option would have worked if the repetitions range looked like `[0-9]{2}`, however because of the **comma** `[0-9]{2,}` it will select 2 **or more** digits (120:000:321). The third option will any range of time digits, single _and_ multiple (meaning `1:2:3` will also match).

- [ ] `$('.btn-primary').not(':visible').show();`
- [ ] `$('.btn-primary').css({ display: 'block'});`

#### Q4. Working with AJAX, we may run into situations where a piece of code should not be run until after multiple AJAX calls have completed successfully. Say we need to call two external services for JSON data (a list of students, and a list of classes). And only after retrieving those data will we perform some manipulations on a page. What is the preferred way for dealing with this scenario?
- [x]
```js
$.ajax('https://example.com/json-api/students', {
  success: function (studentRequest) {$.ajax('https://example.com/json-api/classes', {success: function (classRequest) {// the rest of the code goes here},});},
});
```

#### Q5. Given the snippet of HTML below, what is the difference between the two lines that follow it?

- [x] .get() retrieves a DOM element, and can't be chained, eq() retrieves a jQuery object, and can be chained.
- [ ] .get() retrieves a jQuery object, and can't be chained, eq() retrieves a DOM element, and can be chained.
- [ ] .get() retrieves a jQuery object, and is zero-indexed, eq() retrieves a DOM element, and is 1-indexed.
- [ ] .get() retrieves a DOM element, and is zero-indexed, eq() retrieves a jQuery object, and is 1-indexed.

#### Q6. Suppose we want to have a ball created from an HTML element (id=ball) move down and to the right from its original location when clicked, and move back into its original place when finished. Given a starting point of this, which of these snippets would accomplish that goal?

```js
$(this).animate(
  { top: '+=100', left: '+=100' },
  {duration: 600,complete: function () {$(this).animate({ top: '-=100', left: '-=100' }, 600);},},);
```

- [ ]

```js
$(this).animate({ top: '-=100', left: '-=100' }, 600, function () {
  $(this).animate({ top: '+=100', left: '+=100' }, 600);
});
```

- [ ]

```js
$(this).animate(
  { top: '=100', left: '=100' },
  {
    duration: 600,
    complete: function () {
      $(this).animate({ top: 0, left: 0 }, 600);
    },
  },
);
```

- [ ]

```js
$(this).animate({ top: '100', left: '100' }, 600, function () {
  $(this).animate({ top: 0, left: 0 }, 600);
});
```

#### Q7. Given the following CSS and HTML codes below, how could you apply the success class to the feedback div?

- [ ] `$.css('.feedback', '.success')`;
- [x] `$('.feedback').addClass('success');`
- [ ] `$('.feedback').css('.success');`

#### Q8. The following page snippet includes a couple of messages in a list, and a code snippet that retrieves a few hundred messages from an API endpoint using AJAX. How can you add these new items to the .message-area--list element in the most performant way?
- [x]

var tonsOfListItems = tonsOfItems.map(function (item) {
  return '<li>' + item + '</li>';
});$('.message-area--list').append(tonsOfListItems.join(''));
```

- [ ]

```js
CSS.$messageList = $('.message-area--list');
$.each(tonsOfItems, function (idx, item) {
  $('<li>' + item + '</li>').appendTo($messageList);
});
```

- [ ]

```js
$.each(tonsOfItems, function (idx, item) {
  $('.message-area--list').append('<li>' + item + '</li>');
});
```

#### Q9. What is jQuery?

- [ ] jQuery is a bridge between Java and Javascript that makes native apps easier to write.
- [ ] jQuery is a plugin for JavaScript that makes database queries easier to write.
- [x] jQuery is a collection of JavaScript functions that makes finding and manipulating elements on a page, AJAX, and other things easier.
- [ ] jQuery is a Chrome extension that allows users to create their own extensions with just a few lines of JavaScript.

#### Q10. We want to create a new jQuery plugin called linkUpdater that can be chained onto other jQuery selector like a normal plugin. It should update all the links in the referenced collection so they open in new windows or tabs. Below is the first cut. What is one problem with this plugin?

- [ ] this needs to be wrapped, like `$(this)`, in order to be chained in a plugin.
- [ ] jQuery plugins can't be safely authored in strict mode.
- [ ] In order to be used by other code, plugins need to be added to the global namespace, not wrapped in a function expression.
- [x] Our plugin should extend jQuery.fn, not jQuery itself.

#### Q11. Generally speaking, when used on a web page, how should jQuery be installed, and why?

- [x] Just before the closing body tag, because we want to avoid blocking other resources from loading, and we use the ready method to make sure our code fires after the DOM is ready
- [ ] Using the highest version number possible because only jQuery 3 and up are compatible with Internet Explorer 7
- [ ] In the head tag because we want jQuery available as soon as possible
- [ ] From a CDN because we want to be able to use jQuery online or offline

#### Q12. Given the following HTML, how could we make this button disappear from the page using jQuery?

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Continue to checkout</button>
```

- [x] `$('.btn-primary').hide();`
- [ ] `$('.btn-primary:visible').not();`
- [ ] `$('.btn-primary').visibility(false);`
- [ ] `$('.btn-primary').show(false);`

#### Q13. What is the difference between `$('header').html()` and `$('header').text()`?

- [x] `$('header').html()` returns the inner HTML of the header. `$('header').text()` returns only the text
- [ ] `$('header').html()` returns only the HTML tags used, without the text. `$('header').text()` returns only the text
- [ ] `$('header').html()` strips all HTML from the header. `$('header').text()` always returns an empty string.
- [ ] `$('header').html()` returns all headers in an HTML document. `$('header').text()` the first line of a text file.

#### Q14. When writing jQuery plugins, we often provide default options that may be overridden by the end user. What jQuery function is most useful for this purpose?

- [x] \$.extend
- [ ] \$.clone
- [ ] \$.fn.extend
- [ ] \$.merge

#### Q15. There are times when you might want to programmatically trigger an event, instead of simply reacting to user input directly. Given this markup, Which choice will NOT cause a click event to the select box when the button is clicked?

- [x] `$('button').on('click.myApp', (function() { $('input[type=select]').trigger('click'); });`
- [ ] `$('button').on('click', (function() { $('input[type=select]').click()); });`
- [ ] `$('button').trigger(function() { $('input[type=select]').click(); });`
- [ ] `$('button').click(function() { $('input[type=select]').click(); });`

#### Q16. You have an absolutely positioned element inside a relatively positioned parent element, and you want to animate that element within its parent element. What jQuery function is most useful for finding the initial coordinates of the `.animate-me`?

- [x] `$('.animate-me').offset();`
- [ ] `$('.animate-me').each();`
- [ ] `$('.animate-me').position();`
- [ ] `$('.animate-me').offsetParent();`

#### Q17. You want to work with AJAX using a Promise-like interface instead of nested callback functions. What jQuery API should you use?

- [ ] `jQuery.sub`
- [ ] `jQuery.ajaxTransport`
- [x] `jQuery.Deferred`
- [ ] `jQuery.proxy`

#### Q18. What is tricky about jQuery's nth- filters (:nth-child, :nth-of-type, etc.) relative to other filters?

- [x] Referring to lists of items, they are 1-indexed (like CSS), not 0-indexed (like JavaScript).
- [ ] They don't return the jQuery object, and cannot be chained.
- [ ] They can return the wrong items if the DOM was recently manipulated.
- [ ] They are not part of CSS, so they don't get the performance benefits of passing through the `document.querySelectorAll`.

#### Q19. jQuery's AJAX functions return objects that implement the Promise API. As a result, you can chain promises and avoid nested callbacks. What does that look like?
- [x]
```js
$.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2').then(function (response) {// Data from first GET is here as 'response'return $.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2');}).then(function (response) {// Data from second GET is here as 'response'});
```

- [ ]

```js
$.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2')
  .catch(function (response) {
    // Data from first GET is here as 'response'
    return $.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2');
  })
  .done(function (response) {
    // Data from second GET is here as 'response'
  });
```

- [ ]

```js
$.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2', function (response1) {
  // Data from first GET is here as 'response1'

  $.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2', function (response2) {
    // Data from second GET is here as 'response2'
  });
});
```

- [ ]

```js
$.get('hhttp://httpbin.org/delay/2')
  .then(function (response) {
    // Data from first GET is here as 'response'
    return response;
  })
  .get('http://httpbin.org/delay/2', function (response) {
    // Data from second GET is here as 'response'
  });
```

#### Q20. You want to have a ball that is created from an HTML element (id=ball) move down and to the right of its original location when clicked, and move back to its original place when finished. What snippet, added to the code below, would do this?

$(this).animate(
  {top: '+=100',left: '+=100',},
  {duration: 600,complete: function () {$(this).animate({top: '-=100',left: '-=100',},600,);},},);
```

- [ ]

```js
$(this).animate(
  {
    top: 100,
    left: 100,
  },
  600,
  function () {
    $(this).animate(
      {
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
      },
      600,
    );
  },
);
```

- [ ]

```js
$(this).animate(
  {
    top: 100,
    left: 100,
  },
  {
    duration: 600,
    complete: function () {
      $(this).animate(
        {
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
        },
        600,
      );
    },
  },
);
```

#### Q21. The way `.wrap()` works is sometimes misunderstood. Given the DOM and jQuery snippets below, what does the modified DOM snippet look like?
- [x]
```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div id="container" style="border: 2px solid red;">
    <div class="item">Here's an item</div></div></div>
```

- [ ]

```html
<div id="container" style="border: 2px solid red;">
  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="item">Here's an item</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- [ ]

  </div>
</div>
```

- [ ] "fast"
- [x] "extreme"
- [ ] 2000
- [ ] "slow"

#### Q24. Though jQuery offers visual effects, it is considered a best practice to use CSS to set up different states triggered by classes, where it makes sense. What's the easiest way to enable and disable a class bounce on an element with the ID dialog?

- [ ] `$('#dialog').classToggle('bounce')`
- [ ] `$('#dialog.bounce').removeClass().addClass()`
- [ ] `$('#dialog').addOrRemoveClass('bounce')`
- [x] `$('#dialog').toggleClass('bounce')`

#### Q25. What is the main difference between selectors and filters?

- [ ] Selectors are used to refine the content that filters have been applied to.
- [x] Selectors are used to find and select content in a page. Filters are used to refine the results of selectors.
- [ ] Filters are used to remove content from the page. Selectors are used to add content to the page
- [ ] There is no real difference. They are both used to build up lists of page content.

#### Q26. You want to create a custom right-click menu. How might you start the code?

- [ ] `$('#canvas').on('click.right', function(){ console.log('Handled a right-click') });`
- [ ] `$('#canvas').on('contextual', function(){ console.log('Handled a right-click') });`
- [x] `$('#canvas').on('contextmenu', function(){ console.log('Handled a right-click') });`

- [ ] `$('p').count()`
- [x] `$('p').length`
- [ ] `$('*').find('p')`
- [ ] `$('p').length()`

#### Q28. As with many areas of JavaScript, keeping track of the meaning of **this** is important and sometimes tricky. What does **this** mean at each of the two points in this custom plugin snippet?

- [ ] At Point 1, `this` means a jQuery object. At Point 2, it means a DOM element.
- [ ] In this case, they mean the same thing: a jQuery object.
- [ ] In this case, they mean the same thing: a DOM element.
- [x] At Point 1, `this` means a DOM element. At Point 2, it means a jQuery object.

#### Q29. How can you make the first list item bold and the next item oblique, in a single statement chain?

- [x]
```js
$('.menu-first > li').eq(0).css('font-weight', 'bold').next().css('font-style', 'oblique');
```

#### Q30. Which CSS selectors can you NOT use in jQuery?

- [ ] You cannot use multiple class selectors such as `.class1.class2`.
- [ ] You cannot use pseudo-classes such as `:not` or `:last-of-type`.
- [ ] You cannot use IDs and classes together, such as `#element.class`.
- [x] None. All CSS selectors are compatible in jQuery.

#### Q31. Starting with some DOM elements in the nested structure below, you assign listeners for the same event to a child element and one of the parents using the JavaScript that follows. You want to ensure that when `.leaf` is clicked, only its event handler will be fired, instead of the click bubbling up and also firing the parent's click handler. What do you need to add to its handler function?

- [ ] `event.capture();`
- [x] `event.stopPropagation();`
- [ ] `event.preventDefault();`
- [ ] `event.stop();`

#### Q32. Using event delegation, you can listen for events on a lot of different items without having to attach separate listeners to each one. But there are times when you may want to check the type of item receiving the event before doing anything, such as checking if an image was clicked versus a text field. Given the starter code below, which choice shows what jQuery provides to help with that process?

- [ ] `$($target.get(0) + ':image')`
- [ ] `$('img').is($target)`
- [ ] `$target.filter('img')`
- [x] `$target.is('img')`

#### Q33. There are many ways to create elements that can be added to the page. Which answer is NOT one of those ways, assuming you have the following on the page?
- [x]
```js
$('#elements').append(<p class="appended">As a JSX object</p>);
```

- [ ]

```js
$('#elements').append(
  $('<p>', {
    class: 'appended',
    text: 'As an attribute object',
  }),
);
```

#### Q34. The `.addClass()` and `.removeClass()` methods can accept functions as arguments. What does this function do?

```js
$('#menu').addClass(function () {
  return $('body').attr('class');
});
```

- [ ] It adds the first class found on the body element to the #menu element.
- [ ] It adds all classes found on the #menu element to the body tag.
- [ ] It replaces any classes on the #menu element with all classes from the body tag.
- [x] It adds all classes found on the body element to the #menu element.

#### Q35. You're working on a site that uses an old version of jQuery, and you want to update to a newer version. What's the most efficient way to do so?

#### Q37. What does `$()` mean in jQuery?

- [x] It is an alias to the main core method of jQuery itself—the same as writing jQuery().
- [ ] It is a utility function that selects the first element from the document.
- [ ] It is a shorter way to write `document.getElementById()`.
- [ ] It is a utility function that selects the last element from the document.

#### Q38. Along with DOM traversal and manipulation, jQuery offers several general-purpose helper functions that fill in some JavaScript gaps, especially before ES2015. Which is NOT a jQuery utility function?

- [ ] `jQuery.each`, a general purpose iterator for looping over arrays or objects
- [ ] `jQuery.isNumeric`, which can check whether its argument is, or looks like, a number

- [x] `jQuery.isMobile`, which can tell whether the user is using a mobile browser

#### Q39. Given this set of checkboxes, how can you select the ones that have the phrase "sun" as part of the value?

- [ ] `$('checkbox').val(/sun/);`
- [x] `$('input[value*="sun"]');`
- [ ] `$('input[value|="sun"]');`
- [ ] `$('input:checkbox').attr('value', '*sun*');`

#### Q40. How can you get an AJAX request to go through without triggering any of jQuery's AJAX events?

- [ ] Set a success callback that returns false.
- [x] Set the option "global" to false.

#### Q41. How do you change the current value of a text field with the class `.form-item` to "555-1212"?

- [ ] `$.val('.form-item', '555-1212');`
- [x] `$('.form-item').val('555-1212');`
- [ ] `$('.form-item').data('value', '555-1212');`
- [ ] `$('.form-item').set('value', '555-1212');`

#### Q42. How would you fire a callback when any AJAX request on a page has completed?

- [ ] `$('body').ajaxComplete(function() { console.count('An AJAX request completed'); });`
- [ ] `$(document).on('ajax-complete', function() { console.count('An AJAX request completed'); });`
- [ ] `$('body').on('ajaxComplete', function() { console.count('An AJAX request completed'); });`
- [x] `$(document).ajaxComplete(function() { console.count('An AJAX request completed'); });`

- [ ] `$('checkbox').val('blimp');`
- [ ] `$('input:checkbox').attr('value', 'blimp');`

#### Q44. Given this snippet of HTML and jQuery code, what does the jQuery do?

- [ ] It makes all the menu items bold.
- [ ] It throws an exception on line 3.
- [x] It makes the first set of menu items, not the second, bold.
- [ ] It makes the second set of menu items, not the first, bold.

#### Q45. You want to take a block of type and animate it to a larger size with jQuery. The following HTML and JavaScript behaves strangely. What is the issue?

- [ ] jQuery does not support ems and will make the type 1 pixel larger instead of 1 em larger.
- [ ] jQuery cannot override CSS in a style attribute, so the font size will not change.
- [ ] The font size was set with a shorthand property, so jQuery will not animate the font size at all.
- [x] The font size was set with a shorthand property, so jQuery will start the animation from 0 instead of from 1 em.

#### Q46. When using the `clone()` function to duplicate an element, what is one of the main concerns your code needs to watch out for?

- [ ] The `clone()` function may ignore data attributes on the original elements.
- [x] The `clone()` function may result in elements with duplicate ID attributes.
- [ ] The `clone()` function may remove CSS classes from the cloned elements.
- [ ] The `clone()` function may not respect the attribute order of the original elements.

#### Q47. When incorporating a plugin into a project, what are the important steps for basic installation and usage?

- [x] The jQuery script tag must come first, followed by the plugin, followed by your custom scripts, all preferably at or near the bottom of the page.
- [ ] Your custom scripts must appear first in the document `<head>`, followed by jQuery, followed by the plugin.
- [ ] The jQuery script tag and the plugin script tag must appear in the document `<head>`, and your custom scripts can follow anywhere on the page.
- [ ] The jQuery script tag must appear in the document `<head>`, but the plugin and your custom scripts can appear anywhere else in any order.

#### Q48. These two script tags show different ways of using jQuery's `ready()` method. What is true about both approaches?

- [x] The code inside them can manipulate the DOM safely, knowing the browser has loaded it fully.
- [ ] The code inside them can manipulate images on the page safely, knowing they have fully downloaded to the browser.
- [ ] The code inside them will be run exactly once per user session.
- [ ] The code inside them is not aware of the DOM.

#### Q49. Which property of the jQuery event object references the DOM object that dispatched an event?

- [ ] self
- [x] target
- [ ] object
- [ ] source

#### Q50. Which describes how jQuery makes working with the DOM faster?

- [ ] jQuery optimizes the DOM in a background thread, making updates faster.
- [ ] jQuery avoids using the DOM at all.
- [ ] jQuery uses a virtual DOM that batches updates, making inserts and deletes faster.
- [x] jQuery code to perform DOM manipulation is shorter and easier to write, but does not make DOM operations faster.

#### Q51. There are some issues with this snippet of jQuery. First, it is manipulating CSS directly, rather than manipulating classes and leaving the CSS in stylesheets. What else in this code is best to avoid?

- [x] The call to `.parents()` is in an inefficient place.



#### Q52. Which choice is an example of statement chaining?

- [ ] `var $p = $('p'); console.log($p.length);`
- [x] `$('p').find('a').children('li');`
- [ ] `$('p > a > li');`
- [ ] `$('p'); $('a'); $('li');`

#### Q53. How can you ensure that some code executes only when a class `active` appears on an element?

- [ ] `$('.element').attr('class', 'active')`
- [ ] `$('.element').with('.active')`
- [x] `$('.element').hasClass('active')`
- [ ] `$('.active').then()`

#### Q54. jQuery has a main function for handling AJAX, and several shorthand function including `load()` that make calling that main function easier. Given this HTML snippet, how can you insert only the second snippet from the source.html file (`div#one`) into the `#load-me` div on-demand via AJAX?

- [ ] `$('#load-me').get('source.html#one');`
- [ ] `$('#load-me').get('source.html #one');`
- [x] `$('#load-me').load('source.html #one');`
- [ ] `$('#load-me').load('source.html', '#one');`

#### Q55. Given this HTML list and subsequent two lines of jQuery, what is the difference in the behavior of `.closest()` and `.parents()`?

- [x] `.closest()` returns `.leaf` and `#main-menu`; `.parents()` returns `#main-menu` and `#sub-menu`.
- [ ] `.closest()` returns `.leaf` and `#sub-menu`; `.parents()` returns `#main-menu` and `#sub-menu`.
- [ ] `.closest()` returns only `#main-menu`; `.parents()` returns `#main-menu` and `#sub-menu`.
- [ ] `.closest()` returns only `#sub-menu`; `.parents()` returns `#main-menu` and `#sub-menu`.

#### Q56. What does this line of code do?

- [x] selects the first list item inside all unordered lists on the page
- [ ] selects the first list item inside the first unordered list on the page
- [ ] selects the first element inside any list items on the page
- [ ] creates a predefined CSS selector that can be reused later

#### Q57. Below is a list of items that you want to be clickable and an event handler function. How can you assign the event handler to every item in the list in a way that is most performant, and also that ensures that the handler is called even if more items are added to the list programmatically?

- [ ] `$('.clickable-list').click(listResponder);`
- [x] `$('.clickable-list').on('click', 'li', listResponder);`
- [ ] `$('.clickable-list').on('click, append', listResponder);`
- [ ] `$('.clickable-list').each(function() { $(this).click(listResponder); });`

#### Q58. What is the difference between $('p').find('a') and $('p').children('a')?
- [ ] `find() traverses only one level down, whereas children() selects anything inside the original element`
- [ ] `$('p').find('a') finds all paragraphs inside links, whereas $('p').children('a') finds links within paragraph tags`
- [ ] `.find() always searches the entire DOM tree, regardless of the original selection .children() searches only the immediate childern of an element`
- [x] `children() traverses only one level down, whereas find() selects anything inside the original element`

[Source: https://api.jquery.com/find/](https://api.jquery.com/find/)

**Explanation**:`Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .find() method allows us to search through the descendants of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements. The .find() and .children() methods are similar, except that the latter only travels a single level down the DOM tree.`

#### Q59. Consider the following markup, used to lay out three balls on the page, all hidden. How can you select the green ball, make it faded in over the course of three seconds, and log a console message when the animation has finished?
- [x]
```JavaScript
$('.ball--green').fadeIn(3000, function(){
    console.log("Animation is done!");
});
```

- [ ]

```JavaScript
$('.ball--green').fade('in',3000).done(function(){
    console.log("Animation is done!");
});
```

- [ ]

```JavaScript
$('.ball--green').fadeIn(3).console().log("Animation is done!");
```

- [ ]

```JavaScript
$('.ball--green').fadeIn("3s", function(){
    console.log("Animation is done!");
});
```

[Source: jQuery Docs: fadeIn](https://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/)

`Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings 'fast' and 'slow' can be supplied to indicate durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied, or if the duration parameter is omitted, the default duration of 400 milliseconds is used.`

#### Q60. Why might you use custom events instead of shared helper functions? For example

- [ ] `Custom events are at least an order of magnitude faster than helper functions`
- [x] `Custom events can be listened for and acted upon across one or more scripts without needing to keep helper functions in scope`
- [ ] `Handler functions for custom events are less likely to be mangled by minification and obfuscation build tools`
- [ ] `It is easier to write documentation for custom events than it is for helper functions`

[Source: learn.jquery.com](https://learn.jquery.com/events/introduction-to-custom-events/)

`Instead of focusing on the element that triggers an action, custom events put the spotlight on the element being acted upon. This brings a bevy of benefits, including: Behaviors of the target element can easily be triggered by different elements using the same code. Behaviors can be triggered across multiple, similar, target elements at once. Behaviors are more clearly associated with the target element in code, making code easier to read and maintain.`

#### Q61. In the HTML and JavaScript below, the animations will all fire at once. How can you make them fire in sequence instead?
- [x]
```JavaScript
$('#element-1').animate({ top: '+=100' }, function() {
    $('#element-2').animate({ top: '+=100' }, function() {
        $('#element-3').animate({ top: '+=100' });})});
```

- [ ]

```JavaScript
$('#element-1').animate({ top: '+=100' })
    .add('#element-2').animate({ top: '+=100' })
    .add('#element-3').animate({ top: '+=100' })
```

- [ ]

```JavaScript
$('#element-1').animate({ top: '+=100' }, {queue: 'custom'});
$('#element-2').animate({ top: '+=100' }, {queue: 'custom'});
$('#element-3').animate({ top: '+=100' }, {queue: 'custom'});
$('custom').dequeue();
```

[Source: jQuery Docs: animate](https://api.jquery.com/animate/)

`the .animate() method can take in a function to call once the animation is complete, called once per matched element. Which is called the complete option for the animate method`

#### Q62. Given this checkbox, how can you determine whether a user has selected or cleared the checkbox?

- [ ] by checking the value of `$('#same-address').val()`
- [x] by checking the value of `$('#same-address').prop('checked')`
- [ ] by checking the value of `$('#same-address').attr('checked')`
- [ ] by checking the value of `$('#same-address').checked`

#### Q63. In some projects, jQuery is not included as a file with an obvious version number (if it has been run through a minifier or other code bundler, for example). How can you detect programmatically what version of jQuery is active?

- [ ] `jQuery.version()`
- [ ] `jQuery.jquery`
- [ ] `jQuery.prototype.version`
- [x] `jQuery.fn.jquery`

#### Q64. Given this snippet of HTML, how can you get the value of the text field using jQuery?

- [ ] `$('input[type=text]').val()`
- [ ] `$('.form-control').val()`
- [x] `all of these answers`
- [ ] `$('#firstName').val()`

`all the listed selectors will target the text field since it has a type=text, a class=form-control, and an id=firstName`

#### Q65. Which property of the jQuery event object references the DOM object that dispatched an event?

- [x] target
- [ ] self
- [ ] source
- [ ] object

[Source: jQuery Docs: event.target](https://api.jquery.com/event.target/)

`The target property can be the element that registered for the event or a descendant of it. It is often useful to compare event.target to this in order to determine if the event is being handled due to event bubbling.`

#### Q66. You want to write a plugin that creates a new traversal function—such as parent() and children()—and behaves like the ones jQuery includes out of the box. It needs to correctly modify the list of selections jQuery tracks internally, build up a list of additional items, and return the merged collection. What do you need to return on the last line of the function in order for this plugin to work correctly?

- [ ] `return this.append(additionalItems);`
- [ ] `return additionalItems.appendTo(this);`
- [x] `return this.pushStack(additionalItems);`
- [ ] `return this.add(additionalItems);`

[Source: jQuery Docs](https://api.jquery.com/pushStack/)

`When you call pushStack() off of the current collection, it will take the given collection and associate it to the current collection such that calling the end() method (after the plugin exits) will return the programmer to the current collection.`

**.nextAll([selector]) method**
`Gets all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.`

#### Q68. You have an element with a series of code (not CSS) animations applied to it that could be triggered by code you control, or other code elsewhere (such as plugins). How can you fire some code when all those animations have completed?

- [ ]

```js
$('#element').on('animationend', function () {
  console.log('Finally, everything is done!');
});
```

- [ ]

```js
$('#element')
  .on('promise')
  .then(function () {
    console.log('Finally, everything is done!');
  });
```

- [ ]

```js
$('#element')
  .promise()
  .catch(function () {
    console.log('Finally, everything is done!');
  });
```

- [ ]

```js
$('#element')
  .promise()
  .then(function () {
    console.log('Finally, everything is done!');
  });
```

#### Q69. HTML5 data attributes allow you to create valid custom attributes to store arbitrary data within DOM elements. jQuery has an API to interface with custom data such as the series of quotes below. How can you mark the second quote as your favorite?

- [ ] `$('blockquote'):second().attr('favorite', true);`
- [x] `$('blockquote:nth-child(2)').data('favorite', true);`
- [ ] `$('blockquote').second().data('favorite', true);`
- [ ] `$('blockquote:nth-child(2)').attr('favorite', true);`

#### Q70. jQuery can create event handlers that execute exactly once. How is this done?

- [ ] `$('button').click(function() { console.log('this will only happen once'); }, false);`
- [ ] `$('button').on('click', function() { console.log('this will only happen once'); }).off('click');`
- [ ] `$('button').once('click', function() { console.log('this will only happen once'); });`
- [x] `$('button').one('click', function() { console.log('this will only happen once'); });`

[Source: .one() | jQuery API Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/one/)

#### Q71. You want to implement the behavior of an effect like `slideDown()` manually using `animate()`. What is one critical point you need to remember?

- [ ] `slideDown()` requires animating the background color; doing so with `animate()` requires the jQuery Color plugin.
- [x] `slideDown()` includes toggling visibility automatically. `animate()` does not automatically set any properties.
- [ ] `slideDown()` requires the element to have a height set in pixels. `animate()` does not.
- [ ] Effects created with `animate()` must be run over at least 100 milliseconds, where `slideDown()` can run as quickly as 50ms.

#### Q72. What is the main difference between the `contents()` and `children()` functions?

- [ ] They both return the content of selected nodes, but `children()` also includes text and comment nodes.
- [ ] The `contents()` function only includes text nodes of the selected elements.
- [ ] The `children()` function only includes text nodes of the selected elements.
- [x] They both return the content of selected nodes, but `contents()` also includes text and comment nodes.

#### Q73. If you JavaScript project involves a lot of DOM manipulation, but no AJAX or animation, which version of jQuery should you use?

- [ ] jQuery 3 compressed
- [ ] jQuery 3 slim
- [ ] jQuery 2
- [x] None of these - jQuery requires AJAX

#### Q74. The `.ready()` function is one of the most basic parts of jQuery, but jQuery also provides a mechanism for executing code when both one or more Promises have resolved and the DOM is ready. Which code snippet accomplishes this?
[x] - D
```js
$.ready(
    $.get('http://httpbin.org/get'),
    $.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/3')

- [ ] const can also be used with mutable types

[reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html#static-fields)

#### Q38. You have a when expression for all of the subclasses of the class Attribute. To satisfy the when, you must include an else clause. Unfortunately, whenever a new subclass is added, it returns unknown. You would prefer to remove the else clause so the compiler generates an error for unknown subtypes.

- [ ] Extension functions use `it`, not `this`, as the default parameter name
- [x] infix functions cannot have default values

[reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html#infix-notation)

#### Q41. What is the correct way to initialize a nullable variable?

- [x] Add the prefix infix to the shouldMatch extension function

#### Q44. What is the difference between the declarations of COLOR and SIZE?

- [ ] Since `COLOR` and `SIZE` are both immutable, they are identical internally
- [ ] Both are immutable, but the use of the keyword const makes `COLOR` slower and less space efficient than `SIZE`
- [ ] const makes `COLOR` faster, but not compatible with Java. Without const, `SIZE` is still compatible with Java
- [x] Both are immutable, but the use of the keyword const makes `COLOR` faster and more space efficient than `SIZE`

[reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/properties.html#compile-time-constants)

#### Q45. Why does not this code snippet compile?

- [ ] Because name is a class parameter, not a property-it is unresolved `main()`.
- [ ] In order to create an instance of a class, you need the keyword `new`
- [ ] The reference to name needs to be scoped to the class, so it should be `this.name`
- [x] Classes cannot be immutable. You need to change `var` to `val`

#### Q46. The code below shows a typical way to show both index and value in many languages, including Kotlin. Which line of code shows a way to get both index and value more idiomatically?

- [ ] In order to change `y`, it must be declared outside of the loop

#### Q51. You have created a data class, Point, that holds two properties, x and y, representing a point on a grid. You want to use the hash symbol for subtraction on the Point class, but the code as shown will not compile. How can you fix it?

- [ ] You cannot; the hash symbol is not a valid operator.
- [ ] You should replace the word hash with octothorpe, the actual name for the symbol.
- [x] You should use `minus` instead of hash, then type alias the minus symbol. // Note: How can you fix it?
- [ ] You need to replace operator with the word `infix`.

- [ ] It converts a complex value type into simpler value types.
- [ ] It creates a mapping between two different elements of different iterables.

**Explanation:** - The synax for `map()` function is `list(map(function,iterable))`. The simple area finder using map would be like this

```python
import math
radius = [1,2,3]
area = list(map(lambda x: round(math.pi*(x**2), 2), radius))
area
>>> [3.14, 12.57, 28.27]
```

- [x] If the return keyword is absent, the function will return `None`.
- [ ] If the return keyword is absent, the function will return `True`.
- [ ] The function will enter an infinite loop because it won't know when to stop executing its code.

#### Q23. What is the purpose of the `pass` statement in Python?

#### Q27. Assuming the node is in a singly linked list, what is the runtime complexity of searching for a specific node within a singly linked list?
- [x] The runtime is O(n) because in the worst case, the node you are searching for is the last node, and every node in the linked list must be visited.
- [ ] The runtime is O(nk), with n representing the number of nodes and k representing the amount of time it takes to access each node in memory.
- [ ] The runtime cannot be determined unless you know how many nodes are in the singly linked list.

**Explanation:** Use `"""` to start and end the docstring and use `>>>` to represent the output. If you write this correctly you can also run the doctest using build-in doctest module

#### Q37. Suppose a Game class inherits from two parent classes: BoardGame and LogicGame. Which statement is true about the methods of an object instantiated from the Game class?

- [ ] When instantiating an object, the object doesn't inherit any of the parent class's methods.
- [ ] When instantiating an object, the object will inherit the methods of whichever parent class has more methods.

**Explanation** - `!=` is equivalent to **not equal to** in python

#### Q42. What does a class's `__init__()` method do?

- [ ] It makes classes aware of each other if more than one class is defined in a single code file.
- [ ] It is included to preserve backwards compatibility from Python 3 to Python 2, but no longer needs to be used in Python 3.
- [x] It is a method that acts as a constructor and is called automatically whenever a new object is created from a class. It sets the initial state of a new object.
- [ ] It initializes any imports you may have included at the top of your file.

**Example:**

```python
class test:
    def __init__(self):
        print('I came here without your permission lol')

- [ ] `fruit_info =('fruit': 'apple', 'count': 2,'price': 3.5 ).dict()`
- [ ] `fruit_info = ['fruit': 'apple', 'count': 2,'price': 3.5 ].dict()`
- [ ] `fruit_info = to_dict('fruit': 'apple', 'count': 2, 'price': 3.5)`

#### Q45. What is the proper way to write a list comprehension that represents all the keys in this dictionary?

- [ ] `fruit_names = [x in fruits.keys() for x]`
- [ ] `fruit_names = for x in fruits.keys() *`
- [x] `fruit_names = [x for x in fruits.keys()]`
- [ ] `fruit_names = x for x in fruits.keys()`

#### Q46. What is the purpose of the `self` keyword when defining or calling methods on an instance of an object?
- [ ] `self` refers to the class that was inherited from to create the object using `self`.
- [ ] There is no real purpose for the `self` method. It's just legacy computer science jargon that Python keeps to stay consistent with other programming languages.
- [ ] `self` means that no other arguments are required to be passed into the method.
- [x] `self` refers to the instance whose method was called.

**Explanation:** - Try running the example of the Q42 without passing `self` argument inside the `__init__`, you'll understand the reason. You'll get the error like this `__init__() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given`, this means that something is going inside even if haven't specified, which is instance itself.

#### Q47. What statement about the class methods is true?

- [ ] A class method is a regular function that belongs to a class, but it must return None.
- [x] A class method can modify the state of the class, but they can't directly modify the state of an instance that inherits from that class.

- [x] A deque adds items at either or both ends, and remove items at either or both ends.
- [ ] A deque adds items only to the top, but remove from either or both sides.

**Explanation** - `deque` is used to create block chanin and in that there is _first in first out_ approch, which means the last element to enter will be the first to leave.

#### Q54. Which of the following is TRUE About how numeric data would be organised in a binary Search tree?

- [x] For any given Node in a binary Search Tree, the child node to the left is less than the value of the given node and the child node to its right is greater than the given node.
- [ ] Binary Search Tree cannot be used to organize and search through numeric data, given the complication that arise with very deep trees.
- [ ] The top node of the binary search tree would be an arbitrary number. All the nodes to the left of the top node need to be less than the top node's number, but they don't need to ordered in any particular way.
- [ ] The smallest numeric value would go in the top most node. The next highest number would go in its left child node, the the next highest number after that would go in its right child node. This pattern would continue until all numeric values were in their own node.

#### Q55. Why would you use a decorator?
- [ ] A decorator is similar to a class and should be used if you are doing functional programming instead of object oriented programming.
- [ ] A decorator is a visual indicator to someone reading your code that a portion of your code is critical and should not be changed.
- [x] You use the decorator to alter the functionality of a function without having to modify the functions code.
- [ ] An import statement is preceded by a decorator, python knows to import the most recent version of whatever package or library is being imported.

```python
def calculate_sales_tax(subtotal):
    pass
```

#### Q58. What would happen if you did not alter the state of the element that an algorithm is operating on recursively?

- [ ] You do not have to alter the state of the element the algorithm is recursing on.
- [ ] You would eventually get a KeyError when the recursive portion of the code ran out of items to recurse on.
- [x] You would get a RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded.
- [ ] The function using recursion would return None.

[explanation](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_recursive_functions.php#Definition-of-Recursion)

#### Q59. What is the runtime complexity of searching for an item in a binary search tree?

- [ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(1) because each node acts as a key, similar to a dictionary.
- [ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(n!) because every node must be compared to every other node.
- [x] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is generally O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
- [ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(n) because every node in the tree must be visited.

[explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/)

#### Q60. Why would you use `mixin`?
- [ ] You use a `mixin` to force a function to accept an argument at runtime even if the argument wasn't included in the function's definition.
- [ ] You use a `mixin` to allow a decorator to accept keyword arguments.
- [ ] You use a `mixin` to make sure that a class's attributes and methods don't interfere with global variables and functions.
- [x] If you have many classes that all need to have the same functionality, you'd use a `mixin` to define that functionality.

- [x] a stacks adds items to the top and removes items from the top.
- [ ] a stacks adds items to the top and removes items from anywhere in the stack.
- [ ] a stacks adds items to either end and removes items from either end.

**Explanation** Stack uses the _last in first out_ approach

#### Q63. What is a base case in a recursive function?

- [x] A base case is the condition that allows the algorithm to stop recursing. It is usually a problem that is small enough to solve directly.
- [ ] The base case is summary of the overall problem that needs to be solved.
- [ ] The base case is passed in as an argument to a function whose body makes use of recursion.
- [ ] The base case is similar to a base class, in that it can be inherited by another object.

#### Q64. Why is it considered good practice to open a file from within a Python script by using the `with` keyword?

- [ ] The `with` keyword lets you choose which application to open the file in.
- [ ] The `with` keyword acts like a `for` loop, and lets you access each line in the file one by one.
- [ ] There is no benefit to using the `with` keyword for opening a file in Python.
- [x] When you open a file using the `with` keyword in Python, Python will make sure the file gets closed, even if an exception or error is thrown.

[explanation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files)

#### Q65. Why would you use a virtual environment?

- [x] Virtual environments create a "bubble" around your project so that any libraries or packages you install within it don't affect your entire machine.
- [ ] Teams with remote employees use virtual environments so they can share code, do code reviews, and collaborate remotely.
- [ ] Virtual environments were common in Python 2 because they augmented missing features in the language. Virtual environments are not necessary in Python 3 due to advancements in the language.
- [ ] Virtual environments are tied to your GitHub or Bitbucket account, allowing you to access any of your repos virtually from any machine.

- [x] a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but has only expression to evaluate

[Reference](https://www.guru99.com/python-lambda-function.html)

**Explanation:**

> The lambda notation is basically an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments with only single expression (i.e, cannot be overloaded). It has been introducted in other programming languages, such as C++ and Java. The lambda notation allows programmers to "bypass" function declaration.

#### Q68. What is the primary difference between lists and tuples?
- [ ] You can access a specific element in a list by indexing to its position, but you cannot access a specific element in a tuple unless you iterate through the tuple
- [x] Lists are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time. Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the tuple.
- [ ] Lists are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the list. Tuples are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time.

    print("There is a lot of people in the pool.")
elif num_people > 4;
    print("There are some people in the pool.")
else;
    print("There is no one in the pool.")
```

- [ ] <br>

```python
if num_people > 10;
    print("There is a lot of people in the pool.")
if num_people > 4;
    print("There are some people in the pool.")
else;
    print("There is no one in the pool.")
```

#### Q79. How does `defaultdict` work?
- [ ] `defaultdict` will automatically create a dictionary for you that has keys which are the integers 0-10.
- [ ] `defaultdict` forces a dictionary to only accept keys that are of the types specified when you created the `defaultdict` (such as strings or integers).
- [x] If you try to read from a `defaultdict` with a nonexistent key, a new default key-value pair will be created for you instead of throwing a `KeyError`.
- [ ] `defaultdict` stores a copy of a dictionary in memory that you can default to if the original gets unintentionally modified.

- [ ] when you need to run two or more chunks of code at once within the same file

**Simple Example**

```python
i = 1
while i<6:
    print('Countdown:',i)
    i = i + 1
```

#### Q82. What is the correct syntax for defining an `__init__()` method that sets instance-specific attributes upon creation of a new class instance?
- [x] <br>
```python
def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
    self.attr1 = attr1
    self.attr2 = attr2
```

- [ ] <br>

```python
def __init__(attr1, attr2):
    self.attr1 = attr1
    self.attr2 = attr2
```

**Explanation**: When instantiating a new object from a given class, the `__init__()` method will take both `attr1` and `attr2`, and set its values to their corresponding object attribute, that's why the need of using `self.attr1 = attr1` instead of `attr1 = attr1`.
